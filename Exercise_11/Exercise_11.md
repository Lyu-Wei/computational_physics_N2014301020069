## Abstract

## Background

## Problem
problem 4.19
Study the behavior of our model for Hyperion for dofferent initial conditions. Estimate the Lyapunov exponent from calculations of \Delta \theta, such as those shown in Figure 4.19. Examine how this exponent varies as a function of the eccentricity of the orbit.

problem 4.20
Our results for the divergence of the two trajectories \theta1(t) and \theta2(t) in the chaotic regime, shown on the right in Figure 4.19,are complicated by the way we dealt with the angle \theta. In Figure 4.19 we followed the practice employed in Chapter3 and restricted \theta to the range -\pi to +\pi, since angles outside this range are equivalent to angles within it. However, when during the course of a calculation the angle passes out of this range and is then "reset" (by adding or substracting 2\pi), this shows up in the results for \Delta \theta as a discontinuous (and distracting) jump. Repeat the calculation of \Delta \theta as in Figure 4.19, but do not restrict the value of \theta. This should remove the large (\Delta \theta~2\pi) jumps in \Delta \theta in Figure 4.19, but the smaller and more frequent dips will remain. What is the origin of these dips?
