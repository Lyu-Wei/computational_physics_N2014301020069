# Exercise_10

## Abstract

## Background
* Kepler's Laws of planetary motion<br>
In astronomy, Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun.<br>
1.The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.<br>
2.A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.<br>
3.The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.<br>
