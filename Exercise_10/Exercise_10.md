# Exercise_10

## Abstract

## Background
* Kepler's Laws of planetary motion
In astronomy, Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun.
1.The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
2.A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
3.The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.
