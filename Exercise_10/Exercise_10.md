## Abstract

## Background
### Kepler's Laws of planetary motion
In astronomy, Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun.<br>
1.The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.<br>
2.A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.<br>

3.The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.<br>
### Prexession of the Perihelion of Mercury
Discrepancies between the observed perihelion precession rate of the planet Mercury and that predicted by classical mechanics were prominent among the forms of experimental evidence leading to the acceptance of Einstein's Theory of Relativity (in particular, his General Theory of Relativity), which accurately predicted the anomalies. Deviating from Newton's law, Einstein's theory of gravitation predicts an extra term, which accurately gives the observed excess turning rate of 43â€³ every 100 years.<br>
