We can always see waves in our life, and strings are which can create waves esaily. There are a lot of things that have strings, such as many kinds of instruments. We will study the waves created by strings now.
![]()

## Background
* Wave Equation
![]()
The central equation of wave motion is
![]()
For numeriacal caculation, we can write it as:
![]()
where ![]() is a parameter describing the relative magnitude of the time step length and segment step length. The best choice of r is 1. Smaller r will raise extra pertubation while larger r can hardly yield results.

## Problem
* Preoblem 6.12. Gaussian initial string displacement are convenient for the calculations of this section, but are not very realistic

## Main Body
* Compare the wave on a real string with Gaussian initial string
![]()

* Compare the string signal
![]()
![]()

* Compare power spectra
![]()
![]()

* Other strings
Harmonic string:
![]()
![]()
![]()
Circlar string: 
![]()
![]()
![]()
Quadratic string:
![]()
![]()
![]()
